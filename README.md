# Admin CSS

Admin panel for managing students and classrooms for the CSS (Computer Systems Servicing) course app. Built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase (Auth + Realtime Database). Reads/writes the **same** `users/{uid}` tree the Android course app uses, so student accounts and progress shown here are the real data, not a separate admin-only copy.

## Features

- **Login** — Firebase email/password authentication, admin-only access.
- **Dashboard** — Aggregate stats across all students (total students, classrooms, average progress, activities completed) plus a searchable student table. Click any student to drill into their per-lesson progress breakdown (lesson completion + activity score), with edit/delete.
- **Classrooms** — Create, edit, and delete classrooms. A classroom's join code **is** its database key (chosen and locked in at creation — pick from a live-generated code or regenerate before saving; immutable afterward) and doubles as a shareable `/join/<code>` link (public page, no login required) showing the code and an app download link. Open a classroom for a **Students** tab (enroll existing students, create new accounts directly into it, or open a student's full record) and an **Overview** tab (live-ish snapshot stats, a per-lesson completion chart, and filters by lesson/status).
- **Progress scoring** — Overall progress is 50% lessons + 50% activities: every lesson adds its share of the lesson half in proportion to the pages read, and every completed activity adds its share of the activity half. Finishing all lessons with no activities reads 50%.
- **Progress reports (PDF / Word / Excel)** — "Download report" on the dashboard (admins: whole school or any classroom; teachers: their classroom), on each classroom page, and on each student's detail page. Reports are generated in the browser and include KPIs, charts (lesson vs activity, before/after activity, student vs classroom average, distribution, per-student bars), a lesson-by-lesson table, a student ranking, a status matrix, auto-written remarks, and optionally one individual page/sheet per student. The Excel file also has filterable data sheets, live averages and data bars.
- **Real account creation** — "Add Student" creates an actual Firebase Auth account (the student can log into the course app with it), not just a database row. This runs through a server-side API route using the Firebase Admin SDK, so creating a student doesn't sign the admin out of their own session (a limitation of the client-side Auth SDK).
- **Download invites** — Since the app isn't on the Play Store, each classroom can generate single-use, emailed-by-hand download links per student (`/download/<token>`): opening the link redirects to the classroom's real download URL and immediately invalidates that token, so a leaked link can't be reused — the admin issues a fresh one ("Resend") if a student needs it again. Automatic email sending isn't wired up yet (no email provider configured); the admin panel currently gives you a "Copy link" button to send it yourself.

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Firebase

Use the **same Firebase project** as the Android course app. Enable:

- **Authentication** → Sign-in method → Email/Password
- **Realtime Database** (already set up if the Android app uses it — note its region/URL, e.g. `asia-southeast1`)

Create at least one admin user under Authentication → Users so you can log into this panel. (Admin and student accounts live in the same Auth user pool — there's no separate "admin" role yet, just whoever you give the login to.)

#### Client config (`.env.local`)

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your project's **Web app** config (Project settings → General → Your apps → Web app `</>` → SDK setup and configuration — not the Android `google-services.json`):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
```

#### Server config (Admin SDK, for creating/deleting real student accounts)

Firebase Console → Project settings → Service accounts → **Generate new private key** downloads a JSON file. Add these to `.env.local` too (these are secret — never prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, never commit them):

```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=
```

- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` and `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` come straight from the JSON file's `project_id` / `client_email`.
- `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` is the JSON file's `private_key` value, pasted as a single line — keep the `\n` escape sequences exactly as they appear in the JSON (don't convert them to real line breaks). Wrap the whole thing in quotes.

### 3. Realtime Database security rules

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null",
    "users": { ".indexOn": ["classCode"] },
    "downloadInvites": { ".indexOn": ["classroomId"] }
  }
}
```

The `.indexOn` hints speed up classroom roster lookups and the "Manage download invites" list. Classrooms no longer need an index — a classroom's join code **is** its database key (`classrooms/{CODE}`), so lookups are a direct key read, not a query. The public `/join/<code>` and `/download/<token>` pages don't need a rules exception either — they look things up server-side with the Admin SDK, which bypasses rules entirely.

### 4. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You'll be redirected to `/login`.

## Data model (Realtime Database nodes)

- `users/{uid}` — **same shape the Android app writes** on signup:
  ```
  {
    uid, fullName, username, email,
    classCode,              // the classroom's join code; absent/null = unassigned
    learningProgress: {
      lesson1: { lesson: { completed, total }, activity: { activityCompleted, score } },
      lesson2: { ... },
      ...
    }
  }
  ```
- `classrooms/{CODE}` — keyed by the classroom's own join code (no separate id):
  `{ name, description, downloadUrl, createdAt }`
- `downloadInvites/{token}` — single-use APK download links:
  `{ classroomId, email, status: "pending" | "used", createdAt, usedAt }`. `classroomId` is
  the classroom's code (same value as its key above). `token` is the random key itself,
  used directly in `/download/<token>`.

A lesson counts as "completed" when `lesson.completed >= lesson.total`. The course curriculum (used to label `lesson1..lessonN` in the UI) lives in `src/lib/curriculum.ts`.

### Known gap: lesson totals for admin-created students

The Android app computes each lesson's `total` from bundled JSON assets at signup. The admin panel doesn't have access to those assets, so students created here start with `lesson.total: 0` until the Android app sets it. See [`docs/android-classroom-join.md`](docs/android-classroom-join.md) for the related Android-side change needed to also capture classroom codes at signup.
